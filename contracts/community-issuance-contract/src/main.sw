contract;
// This contract, CommunityIssuance, manages the issuance of FPT (Fluid Protocol Token) to the Stability Pool.
// It controls the distribution of FPT over time, implementing a decay function for token release.
//
// Key functionalities include:
// - Initializing the contract with necessary parameters
// - Calculating and issuing FPT based on time elapsed since deployment
// - Managing the transition of rewards distribution from an initial rapid issuance to a more gradual long-term rate
// - Interfacing with the Stability Pool to send FPT
// - Providing admin functions for contract management
//
// The contract uses a mathematical model to determine token issuance, ensuring a controlled
// and predictable distribution of FPT to incentivize participation in the Stability Pool.
// It also handles the transition period between different issuance rates, allowing for
// a smooth change in the token distribution strategy over time.
