# Fluid Protocol

Fluid is a decentralized protocol that allows holders of certain Assets to obtain maximum liquidity against
their collateral without paying interest. After locking up their assets as collateral in a smart contract and
creating an individual position called a "trove", the user can get instant liquidity by minting USDF,
a USD-pegged stablecoin. Each trove is required to be collateralized at a minimum of 135%. Any
owner of USDF can redeem their stablecoins for the underlying collateral at any time.

An unprecedented liquidation mechanism based on incentivized stability deposits and a redistribution
cycle from riskier to safer troves provides stability at a much lower collateral ratio than current
systems. Stability is maintained via economically-driven user interactions and arbitrage, rather
than by active governance or monetary interventions.

## Contracts
